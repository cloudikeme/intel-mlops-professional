# Components of Traditional AI Solutions

The basic fundatamentals of an AI system include: the ML pipeline, Compute Infrastructure and the User Interface.

## 1. ML Pipeline

The typical ML Pipeline consists of three core components which are Data Processing, Model Development and Inference.

### 1.1. Data Processing

Data Preprocessing is a fundamental component of a typical ML Pipeline. It involves the process of preparing and transforming raw data into a format suitable for model training. The quality and suitability of the processed data, has a significant impact on the machine learning model built upon it.  Data processing can be broken into threee (3) steps:

* **Collection:** Data collection, gathering
* **Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
* **Feature Engineering:**

### 1.3. Inference

## 2. Compute Infrastructure

## 3. User Interface
