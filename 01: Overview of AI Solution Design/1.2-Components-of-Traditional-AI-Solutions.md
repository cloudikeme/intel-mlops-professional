# Components of Traditional AI Solutions

The basic fundatamentals of an AI system include: the ML pipeline, Compute Infrastructure and the User Interface.

## 1. ML Pipeline

The typical ML Pipeline consists of three core components: 

### 1.1. Data Processing

This is a core component of a typical ML Pipeline. In involves the process of preparing and transforming raw data into a format suitable for model training. Data processing can be broken into threee (3) steps:

* **Collection:** 
* **Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
* **Feature Engineering:**

### 1.2. Model Development

### 1.3. Inference

## 2. Compute Infrastructure

## 3. User Interface
